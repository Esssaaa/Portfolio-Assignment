# Portfolio-Assignment
Nonlinear portfolio optimization is a culmination of what weâ€™ve learned throughout the MSBA program. The purpose of this assignment was to bring together R, MySQL, Gurobi, Python, Excel, and Solver. In this assignment, we take monthly data from the historic returns of nasdaq stocks from the years 2000 - 2009. Using this data we create a portfolio that maximizes the Expected Return given a certain risk tolerance. In this scenario, we use the Markowitz theory of portfolio optimization. According to this theory, risk is modeled using the variance and correlations of each stock. This theory states that to take on more risk, a portfolio should provide greater return. This creates an efficient frontier that models how return should increase as risk increases. In this assignment, we attempt to model that frontier using the real historical data.
